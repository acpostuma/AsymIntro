I have some new data files on lark
These are in a folder called nobackup since they are a little large
Use the "scp" command to copy these files to somewhere that you can use them
(Basic syntax is "scp path_to_file destination")

Then you should have all the Q2=3, W=2.32 data:
Left, right, and center, positive and negative

Tasks:

1. Check that your PID cuts seem to make sense for the left and right data sets as well
2. Run the asymmetry calculation for the left and right data sets
3. Use the script "WeightAvg.C" to take a weighted average of left, right, and center data
4. Choose some -t bins: instructions below

This should be more than enough to keep you busy until I get back.
If you don't start any of it until after the conference, that is just fine!
But I want to leave you with something so you don't get bored :)


Choosing -t bins:
1. Plot the -t distribution (tree branch "MandelT")
2. Plot all 3 -t distributions on the same plot (left, right, and center)
3. Create a histogram that sums the left, right, and center data
   Hint: see "FirstAsym.C" for how I add and subtract histograms
4. Try to divide into 3 or 4 bins with the same number of events
   Hint: h1->Integral(0,100) returns the number of events in 
   histogram h1 in bins 0 through 100
